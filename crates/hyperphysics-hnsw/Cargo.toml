# hyperphysics-hnsw
# ==================
# The PROCESSING layer in our triangular architecture.
#
# This crate provides sub-microsecond similarity search using USearch's
# HNSW implementation with custom hyperbolic distance metrics for
# HyperPhysics consciousness space.
#
# Role in the triangular model:
# - Constrains ACQUISITION: Only patterns retrievable in <1μs are useful
# - Constrains EVOLUTION: Processing requirements shape optimization goals
# - Receives from ACQUISITION: Patterns promoted from streaming LSH
# - Receives from EVOLUTION: Optimized parameters from thermodynamic tuning
