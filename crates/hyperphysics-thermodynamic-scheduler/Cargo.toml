Thermodynamic Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler based on Ising Model Physics.

Novel contribution: Uses statistical physics principles (Ising model critical temperature,
Boltzmann statistics, simulated annealing) to adaptively set learning rates based on the
"temperature" of the loss landscape.

Wolfram-Verified Constants:
- Critical temperature: T_c = 2.269185314213022 (Onsager 1944)
- Boltzmann sampling: P(s=1) = σ((h-bias)/T)
- Logarithmic cooling: T(t) = T₀/ln(1+kt)
