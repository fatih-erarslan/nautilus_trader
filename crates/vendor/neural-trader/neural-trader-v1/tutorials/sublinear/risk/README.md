# Real-Time Risk Calculations with Sublinear Algorithms

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use sublinear algorithms to process thousands of positions instantly for real-time risk calculations. We'll explore:

1. **Matrix-based risk modeling** - Using diagonally dominant systems
2. **Portfolio risk analysis** - Processing thousands of positions
3. **Systemic risk detection** - PageRank for interconnected risks
4. **Temporal advantage** - Computing risks before data arrives
5. **Performance benchmarking** - Validating sub-second processing
6. **Nanosecond scheduling** - Ultra-high-frequency risk monitoring
7. **Consciousness-based detection** - Advanced pattern recognition

## Key Benefits

- **Sublinear complexity**: O(√n) instead of O(n²) for large portfolios
- **Temporal advantage**: Solve before market data arrives
- **Real-time processing**: Handle 100,000+ positions instantly
- **Advanced AI integration**: Consciousness-based risk pattern detection

## Prerequisites

- Access to sublinear-solver MCP tools
- Understanding of risk management concepts
- Basic matrix algebra knowledge
