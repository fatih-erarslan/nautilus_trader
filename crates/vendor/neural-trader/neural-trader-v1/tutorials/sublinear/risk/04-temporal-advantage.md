# Part 4: Temporal Advantage - Computing Before Data Arrives

## Systemic Risk Rankings (PageRank Results)

### Risk Contagion Priority (Highest to Lowest)
1. **Currencies (Node 4)**: 0.02124 - Highest systemic risk
2. **Equities (Node 0)**: 0.02080 - High risk spreader
3. **Commodities (Node 2)**: 0.01378 - Medium risk
4. **Real Estate (Node 3)**: 0.01348 - Medium risk
5. **Bonds (Node 1)**: 0.01179 - Lowest systemic risk

### Key Insights
- Currencies pose the highest systemic risk despite small position size
- Bonds are the safest from a contagion perspective
- Total systemic risk score: 0.081 (low overall contagion risk)

## Temporal Computational Advantage

Now let's demonstrate the revolutionary capability of solving risk calculations before market data even arrives using light-speed physics principles.

### Scenario: Tokyo to New York Data Transmission
- **Distance**: 10,900 km
- **Light Travel Time**: ~36.3 milliseconds
- **Our Goal**: Solve risk matrix in < 36ms
