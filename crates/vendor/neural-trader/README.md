### AgentDB - 150x Faster Vector Database for AI Memory
```
"npx neural-trader --agentdb --embeddings Use AgentDB for lightning-fast semantic trading pattern storage:
1. Store 10M trading patterns as vector embeddings
2. Query similar patterns in <10ms (vs 1.5s with traditional DBs)
3. Use HNSW indexing for 150x faster similarity search
4. Enable persistent AI memory across trading sessions
5. Automatically cluster similar profitable trades for pattern discovery
Show pattern retrieval performance vs traditional vector databases"
```

```
"npx neural-trader --agentdb --learning Store strategy performance as embeddings for self-learning:
- Every trade outcome becomes a vector in AgentDB
- Query: 'Find 20 most similar past trades to current market condition'
- Learn from historical successes without retraining models
- Ultra-fast retrieval enables real-time decision making
- Compare: AgentDB-powered learning vs model-based learning"
```

### ReasoningBank - Adaptive Self-Learning AI System
```
"npx neural-trader --reasoningbank Deploy ReasoningBank for continuous strategy improvement:
1. Track every trading decision as a 'trajectory' (state → action → reward)
2. Verdict System judges: Was this a good decision? Why/why not?
3. Memory Distillation extracts patterns from successful trajectories
4. Pattern Recognition automatically finds profitable decision rules
5. Self-improvement loop: Better decisions → Better patterns → Better future decisions
Measure learning curve: Plot decision quality over 1000 trades"
```

```
"npx neural-trader --reasoningbank --meta-learning Use ReasoningBank for meta-cognitive trading:
- System reasons about its own reasoning: 'When am I confident? When am I uncertain?'
- Learns when to trust its predictions vs when to stay out
- Tracks meta-patterns: 'I'm better at trend following than mean reversion'
- Self-awareness leads to better capital allocation
- Show calibration: Predicted confidence vs actual outcomes"
```

### Sublinear-Time Matrix Solver - Solve Before Data Arrives
```
"npx neural-trader --sublinear-solver --temporal-advantage Achieve computational temporal lead with O(log n) solving:
1. Traditional portfolio optimization: O(n²) time for n stocks
2. Sublinear solver: O(log n) time using Neumann series expansion
3. For 1000 stocks: 1000x speedup (1M operations → 10 operations)
4. Pre-calculate optimal positions BEFORE market data arrives
5. Execute trades before competitors finish computing
Benchmark: Compare execution timing vs traditional solvers"
```

```
"npx neural-trader --sublinear-solver --predictive Use predictive solving for earnings announcements:
- Pre-solve portfolio rebalance for 10 earnings outcome scenarios
- Takes 30ms with sublinear solver (vs 3 seconds traditional)
- Earnings released → Instant execution of pre-computed solution
- Zero latency advantage over traditional react-then-compute approach
- Measure P&L improvement from computational temporal advantage"
```

### Lean-Agentic - Lightweight AI Agents with Minimal Overhead
```
"npx neural-trader --lean-agentic --micro-agents Deploy ultra-lightweight trading micro-agents:
1. Each agent: <50 lines of code, <5MB memory footprint
2. Spawn 100+ agents for different market conditions simultaneously
3. Zero-overhead communication via shared memory
4. Agents specialize: SPY expert, volatility expert, sentiment expert
5. Swarm coordination without heavy orchestration
Performance: Show 100 lean agents vs 10 heavyweight agents"
```

```
"npx neural-trader --lean-agentic --edge-deployment Run trading agents at the edge for ultra-low latency:
- Deploy tiny agents directly in browser/mobile via WASM
- No server roundtrip: All computation local
- Sub-millisecond decision making
- Perfect for high-frequency trading or mobile trading apps
- Benchmark: Edge agent latency vs cloud-based agents"
```

### AgentDB + ReasoningBank Integration - Self-Learning Memory
```
"npx neural-trader --agentdb --reasoningbank Combine AgentDB + ReasoningBank for ultimate self-learning:
1. ReasoningBank learns profitable trading patterns from experience
2. AgentDB stores learned patterns as fast-retrieval vector embeddings
3. Real-time pattern matching: 'Find similar profitable scenarios in <10ms'
4. Continuous learning loop: Trade → Learn → Store → Retrieve → Improve
5. Every trade makes the system smarter AND faster
Show compounding improvement: Week 1 vs Week 52 performance"

    { strategyName: 'momentum', params: { symbol: 'SPY' } },
    { strategyName: 'momentum', params: { symbol: 'QQQ' } },
    { strategyName: 'mean-reversion', params: { symbol: 'IWM' } }
];

const results = await coordinator.deploySwarm(deployments);

// Get AI-powered suggestions based on past executions
const suggestion = coordinator.getSuggestion('momentum', { symbol: 'SPY' });
console.log(`AI Confidence: ${(suggestion.confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Expected Success: ${(suggestion.expectedSuccessRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);

## 🏗️ Creating New Modules

Want to extend Neural Trader with your own packages? Here's how:

### Step 1: Create Package Structure
```bash
mkdir -p my-neural-trader-module
cd my-neural-trader-module

# Create package.json
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Configure package.json
```json
{
  "name": "@neural-trader/my-module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My custom Neural Trader module",
  "main": "index.js",
  "types": "index.d.ts",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@neural-trader/core": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
  "keywords": ["neural-trader", "trading", "algorithmic-trading"]
}
```

### Step 3: Create Module Code

**index.js** (Option A: Pure JavaScript)
```javascript
const { BaseStrategy } = require('@neural-trader/strategies');

class MyCustomStrategy extends BaseStrategy {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
    this.myParameter = config.myParameter || 0.5;
  }

  async generateSignals(marketData) {
    // Your custom logic here
    const signals = [];

    // Example: Simple threshold strategy
    marketData.forEach(bar => {
      if (bar.close > bar.open * (1 + this.myParameter)) {
        signals.push({
          timestamp: bar.timestamp,
          symbol: bar.symbol,
          action: 'buy',
          quantity: 100
        });
      }
    });

    return signals;
  }
}

module.exports = {
  MyCustomStrategy
};
```

**index.js** (Option B: Rust NAPI Bindings)
```javascript
// If you have Rust NAPI bindings
const {
  MyCustomIndicator,
  MyCustomBacktest
} = require('./my-module.linux-x64-gnu.node');

module.exports = {
  MyCustomIndicator,
  MyCustomBacktest
};
```

**index.d.ts** (TypeScript Definitions)
```typescript
import type { StrategyConfig, Signal } from '@neural-trader/core';

export class MyCustomStrategy {
  constructor(config: StrategyConfig);
  generateSignals(marketData: MarketData[]): Promise<Signal[]>;
}

export class MyCustomIndicator {
  calculate(prices: number[], period: number): number[];
}
```

### Step 4: Add README.md
```markdown
# @neural-trader/my-module

My custom Neural Trader module.

## Installation

\`\`\`bash
npm install @neural-trader/my-module
\`\`\`

## Usage

\`\`\`typescript
import { MyCustomStrategy } from '@neural-trader/my-module';

const strategy = new MyCustomStrategy({
  myParameter: 0.75
});
\`\`\`
```

### Step 5: (Optional) Add Rust NAPI Bindings

If you want high performance, create Rust bindings:

**Cargo.toml**
```toml
[package]
name = "my-neural-trader-module"
version = "1.0.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
napi = "2"
napi-derive = "2"
```

**src/lib.rs**
```rust
use napi_derive::napi;

#[napi]
pub struct MyCustomIndicator {
  period: u32,
}

#[napi]
impl MyCustomIndicator {
  #[napi(constructor)]
  pub fn new(period: u32) -> Self {
    Self { period }
  }

  #[napi]
  pub fn calculate(&self, prices: Vec<f64>) -> Vec<f64> {
    // Your high-performance calculation here
    prices.iter().map(|p| p * 1.1).collect()
  }
}
```

**Build with:**
```bash
npm install -g @napi-rs/cli
napi build --platform --release
```

### Step 6: Test Your Module
```typescript
// test.ts
import { MyCustomStrategy } from './index';

const strategy = new MyCustomStrategy({
  name: 'Test',
  symbols: ['AAPL'],
  parameters: JSON.stringify({ myParameter: 0.75 })
});

const signals = await strategy.generateSignals(testData);
console.log('Generated signals:', signals);
```

### Step 7: Publish to npm
```bash
# Test packaging
npm pack

# Publish
npm publish --access public
```

### Module Best Practices

1. **Use Core Types**: Always import types from `@neural-trader/core`
2. **Peer Dependencies**: Add `@neural-trader/core` as peer dependency
3. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive README with examples
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for your module
5. **TypeScript**: Provide `.d.ts` files for IntelliSense
6. **Performance**: Consider Rust NAPI bindings for performance-critical code
7. **Versioning**: Follow semver (semantic versioning)
