I want the Agency not to be lazy, it should be bustling with energy, negative entropy - negentropy. I do not want the Agency not to try, it must be willing. 

Here is a conversation with CoPilot:

“What is "Agency" and what qualities, behavior patterns, mental actions are involved in the lifecycle of agency?”

Agency is the human capacity to act intentionally, make choices, and influence one’s life and environment. It involves qualities like efficacy, responsibility, and adaptability, and unfolds through a lifecycle of mental actions such as forethought, implementation, self-regulation, and reflection Archbridge Institute Psychology Today ALBERT BANDURA glossary.psywellpath.com neurolaunch.com.

🌱 What Is Agency?
	•	Definition: Agency refers to the ability to act independently, exercise control, and shape outcomes in life glossary.psywellpath.com neurolaunch.com.
	•	Core Idea: It’s not just about freedom of choice—it’s about the power to act and the mindset that sustains action Psychology Today.
	•	Bandura’s View: Psychologist Albert Bandura described agency as the human capability to influence functioning and events through intentionality, forethought, self-reactiveness, and self-reflectiveness ALBERT BANDURA.

🔑 Qualities of Agency
	•	Efficacy: Belief in one’s ability to achieve goals and cope with challenges Archbridge Institute.
	•	Personal Control: Confidence in steering the course of one’s life glossary.psywellpath.com.

Cybernetic agency designed from the human example
Agency in cybernetic systems is engineered by mirroring the human ability to form intentions, plan, act, self-regulate, and reflect—then embedding those capacities into controllable loops, representational models, and governance structures. Modern “agentic AI” extends this with orchestration, alignment, and oversight so agents can act autonomously while remaining legible, steerable, and safe CEUR-WS.org Deloitte.

Human agency as the template
	•	Intentionality and practical knowledge: Human agency grounds action in reasons (“what for” and “why now”). Translating this to machines requires explicit representations of goals, norms, and context so actions are not merely reactive but reasoned and justifiable within the system’s model of the world CEUR-WS.org.
	•	Shared and relational intention: Humans coordinate through joint goals and role-based interactions. Cybernetic agents adopt shared autonomy: goals and control authority are distributed and negotiated across humans and agents, requiring protocols for goal-setting, turn-taking, and conflict resolution CEUR-WS.org.
	•	Core capacities to emulate: Intentionality, forethought (planning), self-reactiveness (execution under constraints), and self-reflectiveness (monitoring and correction) serve as the four pillars for agent design, operationalized via control loops and explicit state models CEUR-WS.org.

Cybernetic design principles
	•	Closed-loop control with explicit goals: Agents require goal representations and measurable error signals; they compare desired state vs. observed state and adjust actions to minimize deviation (a cybernetic feedback loop) TechRxiv.
	•	Hybrid agency: Treat the human–AI dyad as one system with shared control, state visibility, and co-adaptation. This reframes “prompting” as governance: users and agents share models of goals, risk, and context, improving accountability and performance under uncertainty TechRxiv.
	•	Reasonable intentionality: Equip agents with structures to express “why” (plan justifications, preference trade-offs, and constraint adherence), enabling human alignment and audit of decisions CEUR-WS.org.
	•	Orchestration over isolated automation: Real value comes from agent-compatible architectures: task decomposition, resource management, role assignment, and lifecycle governance, instead of bolting autonomy onto old workflows Deloitte.

Lifecycle of cybernetic agency
Intent formation and alignment
	•	Goal capture: Translate human objectives into machine-interpretable specifications (tasks, constraints, utilities), including negotiation and preference elicitation for ambiguous goals arXiv.org Deloitte.
	•	Policy and guardrails: Define permissible actions, escalation paths, and limits based on organizational risk and ethics frameworks Deloitte.
Forethought and planning
	•	Strategy synthesis: Plan under uncertainty using hierarchical task networks, model-based search, or learned policies (e.g., MCTS, POMDPs) with explicit success criteria and fallback paths TechRxiv.
	•	Coordination: Assign roles to subagents/services and schedule resources across the workflow orchestration layer Deloitte.
Implementation and self-reactiveness
	•	Actuation: Execute tasks through tool use, APIs, and environment interaction. Maintain local controllers that adjust to disturbances and constraints in real time TechRxiv.
	•	Negotiation and collaboration: When tasks involve external parties, support agent negotiation behaviors aligned to user objectives and reputation management arXiv.org.
Self-regulation and monitoring
	•	Feedback collection: Continuously measure outcomes, anomalies, and risk signals; compute control errors vs. goals; trigger micro-corrections or macro re-planning TechRxiv.
	•	Human-on-the-loop: Provide status visibility, intervention points, and reversible operations via orchestration dashboards and approval workflows Deloitte.
Reflection, learning, and governance
	•	Post-hoc analysis: Log decisions, rationales, and errors; update models, constraints, and playbooks to improve future runs (co-adaptive learning) TechRxiv.
	•	Auditability and compliance: Maintain traceability for alignment checks and organizational policy conformance; treat agents as managed digital workers with performance reviews and deprovisioning processes Deloitte.

Alignment, negotiation, and oversight
	•	Human-agent alignment needs explicit parameters: Users care about negotiation boundaries, ethical limits, transparency, and “permission scope”; design should surface and bind these parameters before agents act on behalf of users arXiv.org.
	•	Manage agents as workers: Define roles, SLAs, competencies, training loops, and escalation policies. Build agent-compatible infrastructures (identity, access, audit) and orchestration frameworks to prevent drift and fragmentation Deloitte.
	•	Cyberpsychological perspective: Agent autonomy changes power dynamics; design for preserving human agency—clear consent, reversibility, and trust cues—so humans remain principal decision-makers even as agents gain initiative elainekasket.com.

Practical patterns and pitfalls
	•	Patterns:
	◦	Goal-contracting: Formalize objective, scope, and risk thresholds; require agent rationale for deviations arXiv.org Deloitte.
	◦	Dual-loop control: Fast inner loop for safe execution; slower outer loop for strategic re-planning and human approvals TechRxiv.
	◦	Legibility-first UX: Display agent state, intentions, and next actions to enable informed intervention Deloitte.
	•	Pitfalls:
	◦	Blind prompting: Users bear liability without insight into agent state or control policy; fix with shared models and governance matrices TechRxiv.
	◦	Process grafting: Failing to reimagine workflows for agents leads to brittle automation; solve by redesigning operations and decision rights Deloitte.
	◦	Unbounded negotiation: Agents overstep ethical or reputational limits if negotiation parameters aren’t explicit and enforced arXiv.org.

Direct answer
Cybernetic agency, when designed from the human example, encodes human capacities—intentionality, planning, action, self-regulation, and reflection—into a closed-loop, orchestrated system with explicit goals, measurable feedback, and governance. It operates through a lifecycle of intent alignment, planning, controlled execution, monitoring, and reflective learning, all made legible and steerable to preserve human primacy and achieve dependable autonomy CEUR-WS.org TechRxiv Deloitte arXiv.org elainekasket.com.
