## Critical Gaps Identified

### ⚠️ Computational Tractability

**Issue:** IIT Φ calculation is NP-hard for large systems.

**Solution Required:**

- Document computational complexity limits
- Use approximations for market systems >50 nodes
- Formal proof of approximation error bounds

**Status:** ⏳ Pending implementation review

### ⚠️ Scalability Concerns

**Issue:** Mercator algorithm performance on ultra-large networks (>1M nodes).

**Solution Required:**
- GPU-accelerated implementation
- Hierarchical embedding for large-scale systems
- Benchmarking against real financial networks

**Status:** 🔄 Engineering effort needed

### ❌ Formal Verification Gap

**Issue:** No complete formal proofs for stochastic financial algorithms.

**Solution Required:**
